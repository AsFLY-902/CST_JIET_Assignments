Question 1:
Single Number

Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. 
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

-------------------
Question 2:

Given an integer array A of N integers, find the pair of integers in the array which have minimum XOR value. 
Report the minimum XOR value. You have an array A[] with N elements.

-------------------
Question 3:

Maximum height of the staircase

Given an integer A representing the square blocks. The height of each square block is 1. The task is to create a staircase of max height 
using these blocks. The first stair would require only one block, the second stair would require two blocks and so on. 
Find and return the maximum height of the staircase.

-------------------
Question 4:

Count of paths in a grid

Given an integer A, find and return the number of paths in a grid of size (A x A) that starts from (1, 1) and reaches (A, A) 
without crossing the major diagonal. 
Since the result can be large, return the result modulo (10^9 + 7). 

NOTE: The major diagonal of a matrix A is the collection of entries A[i][j] where i == j

Input Format : The only argument given is integer A. 

Output Format : Return the number of paths modulo (10^9 + 7). 

Constraints : 1 <= A <= 10^6

For Example

Input 1 : A = 2
Output 1 : 1

Input 2: A = 5
Output 2: 14

-------------------
Question 5:

Square Root of Integer

Given an integar A. Compute and return the square root of A.

If A is not a perfect square, return floor(sqrt(A)).
